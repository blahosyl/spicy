## HTML validation

### Allauth template: known issue

The allauth template for [`signup.html`](templates/account/signup.html) has a [known issue](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C026PTF46F5/p1711715226907449) that produces validation errors. Since this is a problem with the framework code, and not the custom code written for this project, and it does not affect the functionality of the app, this was not corrected.
